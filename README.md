# Project Title

This is the technical assignment to call MAS API to retrieve the bank and financial companies interest rates.  

## Requirements Overview

The requirement is for user to compare rates and check the trend.  For this a UI is almost a must as it will be more user friendly.  Ideally a graphs or charts is needed (open source chart like chart.js cant be used).  However, since the business requirements specifically mention no requirement to plot graphs or chart, it is not included as the assumption is user are evaluating other graphs or charts engine hence just want to see the raw data as of now.

This project is created using Spring MVC + Freemarker.  It follows the standard web with the usage of JQuery in the markup.  I can't make the backend work to call the API, hence I use JQuery Ajax and send the response over to the server for processing.

The application layer will be MVC plus a business layer (tsk.techassignment.process).
